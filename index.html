					<h1>Background</h1>	
					<p>In my early years, I lived in a small town called Taman Melawati nearby Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. My family is a simple and middle-class working family where my mother is a housewife and my father is a banking officer.
					I have 2 little sisters and 2 little brothers. In 2010, I got married and now I have a lovely family with 4 kids. Currently, we are settling down in Yokohama, Japan. In my free time, I love to watch Netflix and read fictional novels books
</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
					<p>My early education starts by entering a kindergarten nearby my house. Later, I continued my school years at Taman Melawati elementary school and Taman Melawati High School. I manage to get a good result to further my study. After I finished high school, I continue my study at Malacca Matriculation College for my university foundation program.
					   Next, I pursue my study at <a href="https://www.uum.edu.my/" target="blank"><b><i>Malaysia Northern University (UUM)</b></i></a>. I spend there 4 years to earn my bachelor degree and I passed it with flying colors. After 10 years focusing to my family, I decided to continue my study. So, in April 2022 I enrolled to <abbr title="The Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics"><b>KCGI</b>.</abbr>
					   With a hectic schedule as a mom and student, I do feel stressed and down sometimes. 
					   However, I have always been inspired by Martin Luther King Jr :<q> If you can't fly, then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk, then crawl, but whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.

						   It is my first experience involved in the retailing industry. Quite a challenging job because I need to handle all the operations in the outlet.
